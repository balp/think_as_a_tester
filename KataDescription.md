Weigh Station Kata
==================

In this exercise you will add tests that find unexpected
behaviours in the weigh station web application. The
application should get data from a number of different weigh
stations around the town. These will report when a lorrie
have been checked in.

The page will show the summary of lorries passing and there
total weight. The application have a REST (like) data point
where the different weigh stations report there data. A
user-friendly page that shows the summary for each station.

The assignment is to write additional tests that show issues
in the current implementation.
