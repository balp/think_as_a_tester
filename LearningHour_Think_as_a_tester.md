Name 2 facts about tester mindset and 1 fact about a coder mindset. 


Consept
-------

Talk about the role of a tester, question how the application
works for the users. The need for the software to prove its
working that it has bug unless it can prove it self free
of issues. The need to get your self into the mind of the user,
and not only on the level of the user wo0uld like to order a book
so I make a test that orders a book. I like to refer to Blake
Norris [article](https://medium.com/@blakenorrish/how-to-think-like-a-tester-7a174ff6aeaf).

Concrete
--------

Test the weigh station kata and find a few bugs.
If needed ask some questions, what should happen if a
lorry have negative load? Can there be a half lorry?
How do we change the name of a weigh station?


Conclusions
-----------

* What kind of issues have you found?
* Did you learn anything new?
* How does this reflect to your normal writing of unit-tests?
